1,Amalgama Red Blend,Viña Lagar de Codegua,2013,"70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah","Bottled at its origin in Rancagua, Alto Cachapoal",14 % Vol.,2.43 g/l,48.000 bottles,"<p>Lagar de Codegua’s winery and vineyards are located at the foot of the Andes Mountains in Alto Cachapoal, at 600 meters a.s.l. The Cachapoal Valley has a Mediterranean climate, with a warm, dry growing season from September through May. Rain occurs principally in winter, between May and August, with annual totals of approximately 450 mm (17.7 in). One of the principal characteristics of the climate close to the Andes Mountains is the large difference in temperature between day and night, which can be more than 20ºC (36ºF). This temperature oscillation increases the color and flavors of the grapes, and therefore the wine, while maintaining the freshness.</p><p>Amalgama Red Blend is made with our own grapes from the blocks of the Esperanza I vineyard, producing 10–12 tons per hectare. The vines grow in deep alluvial soils with good drainage, allowing us to control the plant’s vigor and yield naturally. The grapes are harvested by hand and then transported to the winery, located in the same vineyard.</p><p>The 2015 harvest was a normal, dry year, with spikes of heat during January. The ripening was even throughout the vineyard, with cool nights and an easy harvest.</p>","<p>The grapes are harvested by hand, destemmed, and placed in stainless steel tanks, keeping the grapes as intact as possible. Fermentation takes between 15 and 20 days, with the temperature maintained below 28ºC (82.4ºF). The alcoholic fermentation is followed by a 7 day maceration, then pressing. The wine maintains its contact with the lees, and without sulfites during winter until the malolactic fermentation is complete in the spring.</p><p>Once this process is completed, the different lots are tasted and blended to create the final wine for each vintage.</p>","<p>In this blend the Cabernet Sauvignon shows its classic notes of black fruit, surrounded by the floral notes of the Syrah, and a hint of spice.</p><p>It’s a smooth and flexible wine, made to be enjoyed young</p>","<p>With well-balanced structure and smooth texture, Amalgama goes well with white meat like chicken or turkey, accompanied by rice, or cooked in a wok.</p><p>We can’t forget a good mushroom risotto, prosciutto pizza, or Caprese salad with buffalo mozzarella.</p><p>It’s a wine to accompany all kinds of pastas.</p><p>If you plan to enjoy a selection of cheeses, make sure to include gruyere, brie, and mozzarella.</p>",—,rsd,clasica,lagar_rosado.jpg
2,Cabernet Sauvignon Unoaked,Viña Lagar de Codegua,2014,"100% Cabernet Sauvignon","Bottled at its origin in Rancagua, Alto Cachapoal","13,5 % Vol.","2,03 g/l",1.300 botellas,"<p>Lagar de Codegua’s winery and vineyards are located at the foot of the Andes Mountains in Alto Cachapoal, at 600 meters a.s.l.

This temperature oscillation increases the color and flavors of the grapes, and therefore the wine, while maintaining the freshness.</p><p>The rocky alluvial soils are loamy in texture, and originated as the result of a landslide some 12,000 years ago during the last glacial period, with a landslide beginning in the mountains and ending in the valley, forming a table of deep soils with good drainage, allowing us to control the plant’s vigor and yield naturally.</p><p>The vineyard is planted principally with Cabernet Sauvignon (36 hectares) and Syrah (5 hectares), but there are a few experimental blocks planted with Malbec, Carmenère, Petit  Verdot, Tannat, Grenache, and Mourvèdre with excellent results. The yield is 8.5 tons per hectare.</p>","<p>The grapes are harvested by hand and transported to the winery in small bins, where they are carefully sorted, destemmed, and placed gravitationally in stainless steel tanks. After a cold maceration of approximately 5 days in stainless steel, at 8–10ºC (46–50ºF), the temperature gradually begins to rise in order for alcoholic fermentation to begin spontaneously with native yeasts. The beginning of the fermentation is slow, with temperatures maintained between 24–26ºC (75–79ºF), in order to maintain the characteristic freshness of the fruit, and aid the slow extraction. During the beginning of fermentation there are short, closed pump-overs, and during the peak of fermentation punch-downs are incorporated to aid greater extraction. The post-fermentation maceration is prolonged, to ensure a good level of extraction and ripen the tannins.</p><p>Once the alcoholic fermentation is finished, the wine is racked to remove the lees and moved to special polymer tanks that allow a certain permeability of oxygen, lending to the evolution of the wine, just as a wine evolves in a barrel. In the case of this wine, we are looking for this evolution without the intervention of the oak. Before bottling the wines are naturally clarified with egg whites, then lightly filtered to ensure no large residuals remain in the bottle.</p>","<p>Cabernet Sauvignon Unoaked, thanks to the large temperature oscillation in the valley, is a well-structured wine with elegant tannins, fresh and fruity, with delicate aromas of blueberries. On the palate, the body is medium with friendly, silky tannins and a long finish. This wine is fresh and fruity, due to the fact that hasn’t been altered with notes from oak.</p>","<p>Due to its principal characteristics, the freshness, smooth tannins, and fresh fruit notes, this wine is ideal for accompanying stews, vegetable and potato frittatas, baked fish with mashed potatoes or rice, all kinds of fresh salads, or alone as an aperitif.</p>",—,csu,clasica,lagar_csu.jpg

After a 2-day cold maceration at 10ºC (50ºF), alcoholic fermentation begins spontaneously with native yeasts, reaching temperatures between 24–26ºC (75–79Fº). During the fermentation, pump-overs and punch-downs are performed daily, determined by tastings from the tanks. Once the alcoholic fermentation is complete, the wine macerates for a maximum of 21 days to achieve the ideal level of extraction. Later the free run wine is moved to second- and third-use French oak barrels for malolactic fermentation, aging, and stabilization. The percentage of new oak is less than 10% of the total, with the aim of maintaining the aromatic notes of the fruit and a smooth integration of the oak. Next the wine is racked, sulfites are added, and is then returned to the barrels for an additional 8–10 months before bottling. Other grape varieties are included in the final blend in small percentages, lending complexity to the wine.</p>","<p>For its structure, smooth tannins, and fresh palate, the wine is ideal to accompany highly seasoned red meats like beef or lamb, with pepper- or mushroom-based sauces.

The fruit is then selected by hand in the harvest patio, then heads to the destemmer. Using gravity, the grapes are moved to stainless steel tanks. Each grape variety ferments separately in the tanks at 12ºC (54ºF) for 2 days until alcoholic fermentation begins spontaneously. The temperature is kept at 24–26ºC (75–79ºF) during fermentation, and maceration continues for 15–21 days. Once the alcoholic fermentation is complete the free run wine is moved to 225-liter French oak barrels, using 10% new barrels. After 12 months each variety is tasted in order to assemble the final blend. Once the final blend is complete, the wine returns to the barrels to age for 6–8 months. The wine stabilizes naturally, and is unfiltered at the time of bottling, aging for an additional year before being released on the market. Cellared in optimal conditions of temperature and humidity, Aluvión Blend should continue aging and developing in the bottle for at least 10+ years.</p>","<p>The base of this blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, lending structure to the wine, with fresh red fruit and rounded tannins on the palate. The Syrah, the next variety in importance in this blend, gives spicy and floral notes. The Petit Verdot stands out on the palate with its pronounced acidity.
